# Design Brief

**Project Title:** Gettin' Groopy

**Project Overview:**
The project aims to develop a visual decision support tool to assist subject coordinators in sorting course and subject participants into groups based on various criteria such as gender, background, location, etc. The tool will run locally on a machine, be multiplatform, and comply with GDPR regulations. By automating the grouping process, the tool will significantly reduce the time and effort required by subject coordinators to manually organize participants, thereby streamlining the administrative tasks associated with course management.

**Project Objectives:**

1. **Automated Grouping:** Develop algorithms and functionality to automatically sort course participants into groups based on specified criteria, ensuring efficient and accurate group formation.
    
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using PyQt, enabling subject coordinators to easily input criteria, visualize groupings, and make adjustments as needed.
    
3. **Customizable Criteria:** Implement a feature that allows subject coordinators to define and customize grouping criteria according to the specific requirements of each course or subject.
    
4. **GDPR Compliance:** Ensure that the tool complies with GDPR regulations regarding data privacy and security, including the handling of personal information of course participants.
    
5. **Multiplatform Compatibility:** Develop the tool to run seamlessly on different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, to maximize accessibility for subject coordinators.
    
6. **Efficiency and Accuracy:** Aim to significantly reduce the time and effort required for manual grouping by providing subject coordinators with an efficient and reliable tool for generating optimal groupings.
    
7. **Feedback Mechanism:** Incorporate a feedback mechanism to allow subject coordinators to evaluate the effectiveness of the groupings generated by the tool and provide suggestions for improvement.
    

By achieving these objectives, the project will empower subject coordinators with a powerful and user-friendly tool to streamline the grouping process, ultimately enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of course management.

    - Implement basic functionality to sort participants into groups based on five different data inputs (e.g., gender, background, location).
    - Develop a user interface allowing subject coordinators to input criteria and visualize groupings.
    - Basic functionality for customization of grouping criteria.
    - Initial implementation of GDPR compliance measures.
    - Initial compatibility testing on Mac and Windows platforms.
2. **User Acceptance Testing (June 15th - August 15th):**
    
    - Conduct thorough user acceptance testing to gather feedback on the functionality, usability, and performance of the tool.
    - Address any identified issues or bugs and make necessary improvements based on user feedback.
3. **Second MVP Version (August 15th):**
    
    - Enhance functionality to allow for more advanced customization of grouping criteria.
    - Implement additional features based on user feedback, such as improved visualization tools and efficiency enhancements.
    - Finalize GDPR compliance measures and ensure all data handling processes adhere to regulations.
    - Comprehensive testing and optimization for multiplatform compatibility, ensuring smooth operation on both Mac and Windows systems.
4. **Final Documentation and Deployment (August 15th):**
    
    - Prepare comprehensive documentation detailing the usage, features, and configuration options of the tool.
    - Finalize deployment packages for both Mac and Windows platforms.
    - Ensure all necessary installation and setup instructions are included in the documentation.
    - Conduct final rounds of testing and quality assurance to ensure readiness for deployment.

By delivering these key milestones and associated deliverables, the project will meet its objectives of developing a robust, user-friendly tool for subject coordinators to efficiently sort course participants into groups while ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations and compatibility across different platforms.

1. **Accuracy of Groupings:** Measure the accuracy of the groupings generated by the tool compared to manual grouping methods or predefined criteria.
    
2. **Efficiency Gains:** Assess the time and effort saved by subject coordinators in grouping participants using the tool compared to manual methods.
    
3. **User Satisfaction:** Gather feedback from subject coordinators through user acceptance testing or surveys to evaluate satisfaction with the tool's functionality, usability, and effectiveness.
    
4. **Compliance with GDPR:** Ensure that the tool complies with GDPR regulations regarding data privacy and security, and verify that all necessary measures have been implemented to protect participants' personal information.
    
5. **Multiplatform Compatibility:** Confirm that the tool runs smoothly on both Mac and Windows platforms without any major compatibility issues.
    
6. **Customization Flexibility:** Evaluate the extent to which subject coordinators can customize grouping criteria and adjust settings according to the specific requirements of each course or subject.
    
7. **Reliability and Stability:** Test the stability and reliability of the tool under various conditions to ensure that it operates smoothly without crashes or errors.
    
8. **Scalability:** Assess the scalability of the tool to accommodate larger numbers of participants and more complex grouping scenarios without significant performance degradation.
    
9. **Adoption Rate:** Monitor the adoption rate of the tool among subject coordinators and track usage statistics to gauge its popularity and effectiveness in the target user base.
    
10. **Cost-effectiveness:** Analyze the cost-effectiveness of developing and implementing the tool compared to the benefits gained in terms of time savings, efficiency improvements, and overall productivity.
